# Procedurally Generated Train

Written in python with Maya commands, this fun little train is complete with:
- Train tracks
- A user-inputted amount of cars
- Everything pre-colored (Although these can be easily changed if so desired)
- Wheel and track animations included!

All that's needed is Maya and a SkyDome Light or Physical Sky

Hope you enjoy :)
